ERD
As described in the README, a normalized foods ERD was originally created. Once the client explained that we wouldn't need a number of these tables, we backtracked and condensed the ERD into Foods, EnviroTypes, EnviroValues, NutriAttributes and NutriValues.

After seeing the ERD, you will notice that EnviroTypes and NutriAttributes are exactly the same, as well as EnviroValues and NutriValues. We could have consolidated these 4 tables into 2 tables, however we had already created models, controllers and tests for these tables and our advisors did not want us spending extra time to make these changes.
