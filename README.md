Notes for team

This is not a comprehensive solution and may not even be the most efficient, but it has a workable search which finds foods and adds them to a list of chosen foods (saved as a session variable by that name).  You can also remove those foods from the list.

Port over what you'd like to use and feel free to revise and restyle it as needed (styling almost certainly needed).  Do not merge this code en masse into your project as I'm not sure that it is fully compatible with prior code. (This is why I am not making a pull request in this case.)  Key files to look at include:

- search.html.erb
- food.rb
- foods.js
- _food_list.html.erb
- foods_controller.rb
- routes.rb

Still need to add calculations to the plate, but that is something you should be able to do yourselves so I leave it to you.  Hope this is helpful.
